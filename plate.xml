What Does Your Company Do?
A user should be able to figure this one out in under three seconds. If they can’t, you aren’t doing it right. If you sell a specific product it needs to be right there on the homepage.

How Do You Do It?
You’re either cheap, or fast, or high quality, or green, or something else; but you need to let customers know. Say what you do (question one), and then how you do it. When they're online people don’t have the time for a sales pitch, so just put it out there as simply and succinctly as possible.

How Are You Different?
Why would a visitor choose you over the competition?]]></content>

	<!-- Clippings -->

	<!-- Clippings are globally accessible content. For example, site logo, background images, seasonal ad images, and other template consistent data between pages are great candidates for clippings. By setting clippings, content editors can control the consistent parts of your template. -->
	<!-- Clippings follow the same pattern as content ingredients. You can see the matching XML tags and field names below. -->
